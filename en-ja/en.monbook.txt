His feature is that it is unique.
Or rather, a messy way of attacking.
Throw your own head.
Occasionally,
while throwing his head,
he loses it when an enemy attacks.
You can see the pockles hanging down
He is so cute.



His head resembles a shampoo hat.
The head's removability is a mystery
By the way, recently because of
his cute head, he is very
popular with young women.
It seems to be said that the
ability to use a pockle is a
requirement for a man.



Pockles have feathers.
However, he cannot fly in the sky.
The reason is that
his head is too heavy.

I feel like I can fly
when I'm throwing my head...
I want to study someday.



His punch is super first class.
Once received, they will be launched
high in the air & take heavy damage.
But, it is difficult to hit, you
have to be very close to the enemy
We struggle with quick characters.
But, gaining attack energy is easy,
so you should hit it more and more.



As you can see,
Johnny doesn't have a "kuchi".
So how does he eat?
In fact, his skin has the
property of absorbing things.
Press food against his body & leave
Put it in his body.
It's better not to touch



Surprisingly,
Johnny has a musical talent. With a
little instruction, he can instantly
learn how to play an instrument.
The day when a band composed of
Johnny entirely may come someday.
Only vocals will need to be
searched for elsewhere.



His attack, spinning around and
swinging his tail, is quite powerful
because he could repel enemies.
I have weight and physical strength.
It can be said that it is among
the strongest of all monsters.
Don't say "I don't like snakes"
and want them to be raised carefully



He looks like this
and he's a pretty stylish monster.

He loves collecting various jewelry,
such as necklaces and rings,
and he always wears them.
What he wants most now is
an accessory to attach to the tail.



Have you ever seen their dance?
If you haven't done so already,
take a look. It will surely show
a very sharp dance.

I believe their brilliant
spin attack is the result
of a dance lesson.



Its dirty, sharp teeth bite attacks
are a terror for all monsters due to
its overwhelming destructive power.
However, the narrow attack range
makes it difficult to use.

The key to winning or losing is
how well you approach the enemy.



Large tusks protruding from the
mouth are likely harder than diamond
I say "likely" because
no one has confirmed it.
These tusks are more
important to him than life.
The one who does not try to touch
is for the sake of the body.



If you do not want to be injured,
do not say "pelican" to him,
even if you are joking.

He is more nervous to this word.
He is a "dinosaur".

Remember ...



Watch out for his fire,
which fires a fireball
as large as your body,
as it is quite destructive.
However, it is a one shot.
Conversely, if you use Meyer,
you want to make sure you get
close to the enemy and hit it.



His HP, or health,
is the lowest rank of all monsters.
It's pretty weak.
Depending on your opponent, you will
have to fight carefully,
not losing in a single attack.
The owner's arm may be
a monster that speaks.



One of my recent concerns is his
alignment of teeth. Can his teeth
be described as "well aligned?"
Certainly they are lined up neatly,
but because they are jagged,
couldn't it be said that
"the tooth alignment is bad"?
Umm...



When asked who is the strongest
monster of all monsters, which
monster do you list? I would say
Speedmaster, without any hesitation.
The lightning beam, a very easy
to use attack, has the speed as its
name suggests.
A monster has no chance.



His overwhelming speed is said
to be due to his strong feet.
This small body can run 100 meters
in just eight seconds.

However, because I'm on a Begoma,
is it only me who doesn't seem to
have any relation to my legs?



According to the popularity
vote by the monster owner, the
Speedmaster has been in the lead for
several years, but he seems to be
dissatisfied. That is the low number
of women's votes, which lags behind
other cute monsters. It's rumored
he's researching cool winning poses.



I don't know where to get it (though
naked), but he throws a bomb anyway.
The bomb boasts outstanding power.
However, it is difficult to hit and
it is good to avoid even if a fire
pillar rises, so if you use a mobile
character with good skill,
it's not a scary monster.



The heaviest of all monsters is Edge
If you get hit with this weight,
you will be bounced off.
But he is also a child of a man,
a child of a monster.

He seems to want to diet a little.
I can't imagine a thin edge...



His head is sharp.
Water like black ink can be
discharged from the tip of this
pointed head, so you can actually
write without a pen. Edge himself
rarely uses this feat. It is because
as you can imagine, looking down and
writing letters is so cool.



Unfortunately, this Merrick Saddle
summon is the least destructive of
all summoned attacks. However, the
attack energy is relatively easy to
accumulate, so it's easy to use.
Still, it's still an unpopular
monster, due to its low destructive
power despite its flashy appearance.



His favorite hooded coat actually
cuts off electricity. In other
words, it reduces the damage of
lightning strikes.
So, hitting him against a
lightning monster might help you get
the battle ahead. That's the point
I want you to remember.



Many people refer to him as
“elephant” instead of “meric”.
It is a nickname derived from the
nose like an elephant, but he seems
to be aware of it, and even if he is
called "elephant", he will turn
around easily. Is it a good guy?
Or are you just not thinking?



He doesn't know if he's a monster or
an alien, but when he sees a stone
dropping, he may be an alien.
And there is only an alien, and the
attack power is outstanding.

Meteor Summoning is the strongest
summoning attack.



It is said that personality
also appears in appearance. He might
be a classic example. Summoning
meteorites requires a long “time”.
Just run away, run away, and drop
the stones that are inevitable!
Umm... As you can see,
it's a sneaky monster.



Leader's head is tactile.
At this antenna, you can feel
various sound waves and radio waves.
Indeed an alien!
He says that as a trained Leader, he
can directly feel the radio waves on
TV and see the contents in his head.
It is enviable for TV lovers.



He with a gun in his arm. There is a
high probability of a successful
attack, as several shots are fired
in a single attack. However, a
single hit does not cause
much damage. After all, it would be
better to fight close and hit all
the bullets at the enemy.



He is, as you can see, a mechanical
monster. Therefore, watch out for
your opponents, as they will take
more damage from lightning strikes.
If possible, you should avoid it.
But why is there
a robot in the monster?
It is a mystery.



He grows despite being a machine.
This is said to be one of the seven
wonders of the monster world.

Some recently published theories
suggest that he secretly modifies
himself in the middle of the night.
But the truth is still in the dark.



His attacks are powerful. It becomes
irresistible because it comes as a
moving electric ball and assaults
itself. Moreover, it does not accept
any enemy attacks during that time.
In other words, it is invincible.
Unfortunately, monsters who have
become enemies have to flee.



Let me explain how his attack works.
In fact, he has the property of
being able to freely change the
voltage inside the body. It is said
that it causes a potential flow in
the body and generates a strong
magnetic field around itself. But
that's just a theory, I don't know..



Frankie is actually a very kind
monster that looks like this.
He loves caring for animals and
takes care of everything from dogs
and hamsters, and even tropical fish
However, he seems not to be able to
take care of cats.
If he can eat it, I think.



Actually, I'm not good at ghosts.

This scream is no exception,
and to be honest,
I don't want to study very much.

What kind of nerves do they say
that they are cute...



I am also a man who is said to be
a pioneer in monster research.
In writing this Monster Note,
I decided to do his research.
When I asked my assistant,
he seemed to have some weight.
But most of it is like the weight
of a sickle you have. The end.



His health is top class
among all monsters.
After all ghost is terrible...

Is it okay to study him
and do something about it?
I won't get attached to me.
Honey, honey...



It is a monster that is troublesome
as an enemy. The beam that he draws
from both eyes not only steals the
enemy's HP, but also makes the HP
that he robbed as his own.
It is almost time for me to take my
HP off and recover. When he starts
firing the beam, just run away.



He is flying in the sky.
So why are flying monsters
on a begoma?
According to my research,
when riding a Begoma, it seems
that the monster controls the Begoma
with something like telepathy.
So you can fly.



I am vulnerable to
a cute woman with double teeth.

That's why this double tooth is cute
Bad Bat, I love you.

Eh?
Don't worry about that?



He has a mysterious ability.
If he's on the same team, his
teammates will earn significantly
more experience than usual.
It's amazing. Great Perinin.
To be honest, I don't think he can
count on his strength, but it's a
good idea to take him into combat.



His assault,
called "Panpawan Attack," is so
slow that it would be hard to hit
the enemy with his aim.
Better yet, how about hitting a
circle from the center of the stage
and leaving it to luck?
At least I do better.



Why can he get so much experience
if he is on the same team?
Some say that he is a favorite
among his fellow monsters, and that
if he sees him, he will do his best,
or that he is a hated person and
thinks he can do it.
Is he really popular or hated?



Despite being a skeleton, the body
is solid and strong and has weight.
His attack is simply to make an ax.
It looks like a skeleton. However,
the ax has a wide attack range and
is quite difficult to avoid.
He is likely to be a lacking
on physical strength.



Skulls are said to be "gentlemen."
For example, when he throws an ax,
look closely at the flying ax.
You can see that the ax is turning
towards the non-cutting blade.
In this case, the blade will not
be cut. Well, she's a gentleman.
(Some say they just don't know)



There is a monster with a weapon.
Some readers may find this unfair.
But that is not the case.
A monster with a weapon has that
weapon from birth. In other words,
the weapon is part of its body.

It is not unfair.



His attack is to create a tornado
around him and involve the enemy.
If you get caught up in this
tornado, you will be thrown into
the sky and take heavy damage. It
also has speed, becomes a tornado
by itself, chasing enemy monsters
To be honest, pretty scary.



He wants to explain how he is
causing the tornado. That said,
nothing is happening, just
swirling your arm at high speed,
creating a breeze. Same as a fan.

Do not imitate you there.
No one can.



I wonder?

There is a religion that praises
Blurr as the god of the wind
and stands up.

I'm not sure what to say
I think it is a bad god.



His attack is to throw wings.
Don't dismiss it as just a wing.
In fact, this wing has the homing
ability of chasing enemies. If you
do not aim to some extent, it will
not chase you, so it's not
all-purpose, but it's easy to use.
A recommended monster for beginners.



He seems to yearn for a ninja.
When you lean into a ninja-style
outfit and throw your wings, you
must throw a shuriken, too.
Recently, she seems to be trying to
master the art of walking on water.
It would be nice if you knew that 
you couldn't use it for battle...



Cam Cam Claw has eyes on fruits.
Especially melon, my favorite.
If it's in a bad mood, give melon
and it'll be in a good mood.
By the way, when I gave melon bread
the other day, I was delighted again
If you want to make it cheaper,
go with this hand.



It is said that foxes
are fragile animals in the east and
west of this age. And it seems the
same in the monster world. This Oaks
is approaching with gloves,
almost hitting it, and actually
kicking with his feet.
How outrageous.



His kicks have a narrow attack range
due to their short legs, and they
aren't that good. But the
destructive power is number one. An
opponent with low physical strength
has enough power to beat it with a
single blow. When he's an enemy,
just fight carefully.



Is his glove really just to fool
the enemy? Recently, a rocket was
actually hidden inside that glove,
In that case, become a rocket punch,
The story that gloves pop out
is true.
It is flowing gracefully.
He is likely scary.



He is a demon.
However, he does not like being a
demon hated by humans, and in fact,
seems to be making a tearful effort
to become an angel.
I realize that one of his efforts
takes him to battle.
You get more prizes and more items.



He longs for angels, but his method
of attack is not very angelic.
How to summon the Reaper,
stop the time, and do damage without
any counterattack.
Enemies hit by such a sneaky attack
shout at him.
"This is the devil!"



Will the day when he can be a real
angel come true?
His opinion is that he is making
useless efforts, but he does his
best today without giving up.
There is no useless effort
in this world. Effort will always
be rewarded somehow. I think so.



If the big opponent in the figure
is an enemy, it will be his turn
as well. The seismic attack can do
more damage as the enemy's
weight increases. To see the enemy
that collapses without enduring
its own weight,
It is the best pleasure for him.



His seismic attack is effective
against heavier opponents, but less
effective when the enemy is a
light monster. So be careful when
choosing your opponents.

The battle starts from
the preparatory stage.



No monster is as popular as a child
and an adult when he is.
When she was a child, she was very
popular for her adorable looks,
but when she was an adult,
she quickly became less popular.

The contents are the same, but poor.



The person who sent the sport using
these monsters to the earth.
It may be the boss of monsters.

There is only a boss, and it is
super first class in all of attack,
defense and movement.
You cannot lose with him.
